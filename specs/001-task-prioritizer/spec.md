# Feature Specification: Task Prioritizer Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-task-prioritizer`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a Task Prioritizer web application. The app has a single page with: - A textarea where users can enter a work task description - A submit button - A side-by-side display area that shows: * LEFT: The original task text exactly as entered * RIGHT: AI analysis containing Priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), Categories (array of tags like CRITICAL-PATH, USER-FACING, etc.), Estimated Complexity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), and a Suggested Order explanation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Task Analysis (Priority: P1)

A user enters a task description and immediately sees their original text alongside AI-generated prioritization insights in a side-by-side comparison view.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the application - users need to see how their task is analyzed and prioritized. Without this, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a task description, clicking submit, and verifying that both the original text and analysis results appear side-by-side, delivering immediate value to the user who can now understand task priority.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on the main page, **When** they enter "Fix the bug in the login form" and click submit, **Then** the left panel displays the exact text "Fix the bug in the login form" and the right panel displays Priority: HIGH, Categories: CRITICAL-PATH, USER-FACING, SECURITY, Estimated Complexity: MEDIUM, and Suggested Order: "Do this before feature work - blocks user access"
2. **Given** the user has submitted a task, **When** they view the results, **Then** both panels are visible simultaneously in a side-by-side layout allowing easy comparison
3. **Given** the results are displayed, **When** the user reviews the analysis, **Then** all four analysis components (Priority, Categories, Complexity, Suggested Order) are clearly visible and readable

---

### User Story 2 - Enter Task Description (Priority: P1)

A user can type or paste a work task description into a textarea input field to prepare it for analysis.

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point for the application - users must be able to input their task before any analysis can occur. It's foundational to the user journey.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application and verifying that a textarea accepts text input with no character restrictions, delivering value by allowing users to capture their task descriptions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens the application, **When** they view the page, **Then** a clearly labeled textarea is displayed for task input
2. **Given** the textarea is visible, **When** the user types or pastes text, **Then** the text appears in the textarea without modification
3. **Given** the user has entered text, **When** they review their input, **Then** the text remains exactly as entered including line breaks and special characters

---

### User Story 3 - Submit for Analysis (Priority: P1)

A user triggers the analysis process by clicking a submit button, initiating the display of results.

**Why this priority**: This is the action that connects input to output - users need an explicit way to indicate they're ready to see the analysis. It's the critical interaction point.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering text and clicking the submit button, verifying that the action triggers the display of the results panel, delivering value by giving users control over when to analyze.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has entered task text, **When** they click the submit button, **Then** the side-by-side results display appears
2. **Given** the textarea is empty, **When** the user clicks submit, **Then** the system displays a friendly message indicating that a task description is required
3. **Given** the user has submitted once, **When** they modify the text and submit again, **Then** the results update to reflect the new submission

---

### User Story 4 - Review Multiple Tasks (Priority: P2)

A user can submit multiple different tasks sequentially to compare how different tasks are prioritized.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the utility of the tool by allowing users to analyze their entire backlog, though the core value is delivered even with single-task analysis.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a task, then changing the input and submitting again, verifying that new results replace the old ones, delivering value by enabling backlog prioritization workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has viewed results for one task, **When** they clear the textarea and enter a different task, **Then** they can submit and see new results
2. **Given** results are displayed, **When** the user submits a new task, **Then** the previous results are replaced with the new analysis
3. **Given** the user is reviewing multiple tasks, **When** they submit each one, **Then** the interface remains responsive and consistent

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user submits an empty textarea?
- What happens when the user enters extremely long text (10,000+ characters)?
- How does the system handle task descriptions with only special characters or numbers?
- What happens when the user rapidly clicks the submit button multiple times?
- How does the layout respond on mobile devices or narrow browser windows?
- What happens when the user enters multi-line task descriptions with complex formatting?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a single-page interface containing a textarea, submit button, and results area
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a textarea that accepts text input of any reasonable length (minimum 10,000 characters)
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve the exact user input including whitespace, line breaks, and special characters
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a submit button that is always visible and accessible
- **FR-005**: System MUST show a side-by-side display with two distinct panels after submission
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the original task text without modification in the left panel
- **FR-007**: System MUST display AI analysis in the right panel containing four components: Priority level, Categories array, Estimated Complexity level, and Suggested Order explanation
- **FR-008**: System MUST support the specific hardcoded example: when input is "Fix the bug in the login form", display Priority: HIGH, Categories: CRITICAL-PATH, USER-FACING, SECURITY, Estimated Complexity: MEDIUM, Suggested Order: "Do this before feature work - blocks user access"
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent submission when textarea is empty and provide feedback
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow repeated submissions, updating results each time
- **FR-011**: System MUST display Priority as one of three values: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
- **FR-012**: System MUST display Categories as an array of descriptive tags (examples include CRITICAL-PATH, USER-FACING, SECURITY, TECHNICAL-DEBT, FEATURE)
- **FR-013**: System MUST display Estimated Complexity as one of three values: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
- **FR-014**: System MUST display Suggested Order as a clear, actionable explanation text

### Key Entities

- **Task Description**: The raw text input provided by the user, preserved exactly as entered without processing or modification
- **Task Analysis**: The structured output containing four distinct fields:
  - Priority: A severity level indicator (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  - Categories: A collection of classification tags
  - Estimated Complexity: An effort level indicator (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  - Suggested Order: A textual explanation of when/why to do this task

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can see their original task text and analysis results simultaneously without scrolling or switching views
- **SC-002**: Users can input a task description and view results in under 5 seconds for the hardcoded example
- **SC-003**: The side-by-side layout displays correctly on screens 768 pixels wide and larger
- **SC-004**: 100% of valid submissions (non-empty text) produce a visible analysis with all four required components
- **SC-005**: The exact text entered by users appears in the left panel with no modifications or data loss
- **SC-006**: Users can distinguish between the original input and analysis output without confusion (validated through clear visual separation)
