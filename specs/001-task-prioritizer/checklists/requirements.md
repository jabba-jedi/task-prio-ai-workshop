# Specification Quality Checklist: Task Prioritizer Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification contains no technology-specific details (no mention of frameworks, languages, or APIs)  
✅ **PASS** - Focused entirely on user workflows and business value (task input → analysis → decision-making)  
✅ **PASS** - Written in plain language suitable for product managers and stakeholders  
✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present; all requirements are definitive  
✅ **PASS** - All requirements use testable language ("MUST display", "MUST accept", "MUST show")  
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria include specific metrics (5 seconds, 768 pixels, 100% of submissions)  
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria avoid implementation details (focused on user-facing outcomes)  
✅ **PASS** - Each user story includes Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios  
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases section addresses empty input, long text, special characters, rapid clicks, responsive layout, multi-line text  
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded to single-page app with hardcoded mock data  
✅ **PASS** - Assumptions are implicit but reasonable (standard web browser, modern CSS layout support)

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Each functional requirement maps to at least one acceptance scenario  
✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover the complete user journey: view page → enter text → submit → review results  
✅ **PASS** - All success criteria are verifiable without knowing implementation choices  
✅ **PASS** - No technical implementation details present in any section

## Notes

**Status**: ✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING

All validation items passed on first review. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Technology-agnostic and focused on user value
- Testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` phase

No issues or clarifications needed.
