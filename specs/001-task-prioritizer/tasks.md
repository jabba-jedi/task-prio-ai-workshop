# Tasks: Task Prioritizer Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-task-prioritizer/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - not included since this is a workshop demo with browser-based manual testing per plan.md.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single HTML file at repository root: `index.html`
- Configuration files: `package.json`, `vite.config.js`
- All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript embedded in `index.html`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and Vite configuration

**Checkpoint**: Project structure ready - can start implementing user stories

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Checkpoint**: Core MVP complete - can enter task, submit, and view side-by-side analysis (FR-005, FR-006, FR-007, FR-008)

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Review Multiple Tasks (Priority: P2)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US2 (Enter Task): Can start after Foundational
  - US3 (Submit Button): Can start after US2 (needs form structure)
  - US1 (View Analysis): Can start after US3 (needs submit handler)
  - US4 (Multiple Tasks): Can start after US1 (enhances existing flow)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 2 (P1) - Enter Task**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P1) - Submit Button**: Depends on US2 (needs form and textarea to exist)
- **User Story 1 (P1) - View Analysis**: Depends on US3 (needs submit event to trigger display)
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Multiple Tasks**: Depends on US1 (enhances the results display workflow)

**Note**: Logical implementation order differs from story priority due to UI flow: Input ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Display ‚Üí Repeat

### Within Each User Story

- HTML structure before CSS styling
- CSS styling before JavaScript behavior
- Core functionality before edge cases
- Story complete before moving to next

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All setup tasks can run sequentially (small project)
- **Phase 2**: Tasks T005-T009 must be sequential (same file)
- **Within User Stories**: 
  - T028 and T029 [P] - different parts of HTML structure
  - T045, T046, T047 [P] - different CSS concerns
- **Cross-Story**: Limited parallelization since all code is in one file

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Due to single-file structure, most tasks are sequential
# However, these HTML structure tasks can be conceptually parallel:
Task T028: "Create left panel structure"
Task T029: "Create right panel structure"

# Polish phase CSS tasks can be parallel:
Task T045: "Add global CSS reset"
Task T046: "Add CSS variables"
Task T047: "Enhance visual design"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 2 + 3 + 1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T009) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 2 - Enter Task (T010-T017)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 3 - Submit Button (T018-T026)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 1 - View Analysis (T027-T039)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test complete workflow end-to-end
7. **MVP READY**: Can enter, submit, and view analysis

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2) ‚Üí Project runs, shows basic page
2. **Input Workflow** (Phases 3-4) ‚Üí Can enter and submit tasks (validation works)
3. **Full MVP** (Phase 5) ‚Üí Complete side-by-side analysis display ‚úÖ
4. **Enhanced** (Phase 6) ‚Üí Multiple submissions supported
5. **Workshop-Ready** (Phase 7) ‚Üí Polished, tested, documented

### Sequential Workshop Demo Strategy

Since all code is in one file, development is naturally sequential:

1. Developer completes Setup + Foundational
2. Developer implements stories in logical UI flow order:
   - First: Input (US2) - users need to enter text
   - Second: Submit (US3) - users need to trigger analysis
   - Third: Display (US1) - users need to see results
   - Fourth: Repeat (US4) - users want to try multiple tasks
3. Each story adds visible value in workshop demo
4. Polish phase makes code workshop-presentation-ready

## Notes

- [P] tasks = can conceptually run in parallel (though single-file structure limits actual parallelization)
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story delivers visible, testable functionality
- Single HTML file means most tasks are sequential edits
- Commit after each phase or user story completion
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All file paths point to `/Users/maryia.yermakovich/Projects/task-prio-ai-workshop/index.html` or config files
- Workshop-friendly: code is clean, commented, and easy to demonstrate

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 57 tasks across 7 phases

### Tasks by Phase:
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 4 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 5 tasks (BLOCKING)
- **Phase 3 (US2 - Enter Task)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US3 - Submit)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US1 - View Analysis)**: 13 tasks ‚≠ê Core MVP
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Multiple Tasks)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 13 tasks

### Tasks by User Story:
- **US1 (View Analysis)**: 13 tasks - Core display functionality
- **US2 (Enter Task)**: 8 tasks - Input component
- **US3 (Submit Button)**: 9 tasks - Validation and submission
- **US4 (Multiple Tasks)**: 5 tasks - Enhanced workflow
- **Infrastructure**: 22 tasks (Setup + Foundational + Polish)

### Parallel Opportunities:
