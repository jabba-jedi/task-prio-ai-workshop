# Implementation Plan: Task Prioritizer Application

**Branch**: `001-task-prioritizer` | **Date**: October 16, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)  
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-task-prioritizer/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a minimal single-page web application that allows users to enter task descriptions and view AI-generated prioritization analysis in a side-by-side layout. Initial version uses hardcoded mock data for the "Fix the bug in the login form" example. The application will use Vite with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks) with embedded styles and CSS Grid layout for a clean workshop demo.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES6+) with HTML5 and CSS3  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite (build tool and dev server)  
**Storage**: N/A (no persistence required for initial version)  
**Testing**: Browser-based manual testing for workshop demo  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
**Project Type**: Single-page web application  
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response time for mock data display  
**Constraints**: Single HTML file with embedded styles, minimal dependencies, workshop-ready (clean and readable code)  
**Scale/Scope**: Single page, 4 UI components (textarea, button, 2 result panels), hardcoded mock data

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: ✅ **PASS - No Constitution Defined**

Since this is a new workshop project without an established constitution, we proceed with industry best practices:
- ✅ Simplicity: Single HTML file, vanilla JavaScript, no framework complexity
- ✅ Testability: Manual UI testing with clear acceptance criteria from spec
- ✅ Maintainability: Readable code structure for workshop demonstration
- ✅ Scope control: MVP with hardcoded data, no over-engineering

**Note**: A project constitution can be established later if the workshop evolves into a larger project.

```

**Structure Decision**: Using the simplest possible structure for a workshop demo. Single HTML file contains all code (HTML structure, embedded CSS in `<style>` tag, embedded JavaScript in `<script>` tag). Vite is used only as a development server and optional build tool. This eliminates the need for separate source directories and makes the code easy to understand and demonstrate in a workshop setting.

**Rationale**:
- **Workshop-friendly**: Attendees can see all code in one file
- **No build complexity**: Direct editing and hot reload with Vite
- **Minimal setup**: `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start
- **Future-ready**: Can refactor into separate files later if needed

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

**N/A** - No constitution violations. Project follows simplicity-first approach appropriate for workshop demo scope.
