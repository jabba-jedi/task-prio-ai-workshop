- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Pass - All Quality Items Met**

The specification successfully maintains technology-agnostic language throughout while providing concrete, testable requirements. Key quality indicators:

1. **User-Centric Focus**: All user stories describe value from the user's perspective ("user submits a task", "receives AI analysis") without mentioning technical implementation.

2. **Measurable Success Criteria**: All SC items are quantifiable or objectively verifiable:
   - SC-001: Same workflow time (measurable through user testing)
   - SC-002: 100% database write attempts (verifiable through logs)
   - SC-003: 100% uptime independence (testable through outage simulation)
   - SC-004: Warning message display (visually verifiable)
   - SC-005: Complete data fields (queryable in database)
   - SC-006: No credential exposure (auditable)
   - SC-007: Developer verification (testable through direct queries)

3. **Clear Boundaries**: Out of Scope section explicitly defines what is NOT included, preventing scope creep.

4. **Comprehensive Edge Cases**: Eight specific edge cases identified covering performance, network issues, schema problems, and data constraints.

5. **Testable Requirements**: Every functional requirement is independently testable with clear pass/fail criteria.

**No Clarifications Required**: All requirements have reasonable defaults based on industry standards for logging, error handling, and background processing.

The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
