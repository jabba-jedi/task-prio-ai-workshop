# Feature Specification: Supabase Database Logging

**Feature Branch**: `003-supabase-logging`  
**Created**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add Supabase database logging to the Task Prioritizer. After the Gemini API successfully analyzes a task, we need to persist both the original input and the AI analysis to a database."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Transparent Task Analysis Persistence (Priority: P1)

A user submits a task, receives AI analysis as expected, and their submission is silently logged to the database in the background without any impact on their workflow or wait time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature - enabling data persistence for analytics, history, and improvement. The user experience remains unchanged, which is critical for adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a task, verifying the analysis appears immediately as before, then checking the Supabase database to confirm the record was created with all required fields, delivering value through invisible data capture without user friction.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user submits "Optimize database queries for faster load times", **When** the Gemini analysis completes and displays on screen, **Then** a database record is created containing the original text, AI-generated priority, categories, complexity, suggested order, and timestamp
2. **Given** the analysis is displayed to the user, **When** the database logging occurs, **Then** the user sees no loading indicators, delays, or status messages related to database operations
3. **Given** multiple users submit tasks simultaneously, **When** each submission completes, **Then** all submissions are logged independently without conflicts or data loss
4. **Given** a task is logged successfully, **When** reviewing the database record, **Then** all data fields match exactly what was displayed to the user

### User Story 2 - Graceful Handling of Database Failures (Priority: P1)

A user submits a task and receives their AI analysis even when the database service is unavailable, experiencing no disruption to their core workflow while receiving a subtle warning about the logging issue.

**Why this priority**: Database failures should never prevent users from getting their task analysis. This resilience is essential for user trust and application reliability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating database outages (invalid credentials, network issues, service down), submitting a task, and verifying that the AI analysis still displays normally with only a non-intrusive warning shown, delivering value through fault tolerance and reliability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Supabase service is unreachable, **When** the user submits a task, **Then** the AI analysis displays normally and a warning message appears like "Note: Task history could not be saved at this time"
2. **Given** a database connection error occurs, **When** the logging fails, **Then** the error does not propagate to the user interface or break the analysis display
3. **Given** the database is temporarily down, **When** the user submits multiple tasks, **Then** each task receives AI analysis successfully despite logging failures
4. **Given** database authentication fails, **When** logging is attempted, **Then** the user sees their results with a subtle warning indicator rather than an error modal

---

### User Story 3 - Configure Database Connection Securely (Priority: P1)

A developer sets up the application by providing Supabase connection details through environment variables, enabling secure database access without exposing credentials in source code.

**Why this priority**: Without database configuration, the logging feature cannot function. Following security best practices protects sensitive credentials and enables environment-specific deployments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY environment variables, starting the application, submitting a task, and verifying successful database logging, delivering value through secure credential management and deployment flexibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer has set both VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, **When** the application starts, **Then** the connection credentials are loaded and available for database operations
2. **Given** one or both environment variables are missing, **When** the application starts, **Then** the system detects the missing configuration and disables database logging gracefully
3. **Given** the application is deployed to different environments (dev, staging, production), **When** different database credentials are used, **Then** each environment logs to its own database without code changes

---

### User Story 4 - Verify Data Persistence Through History (Priority: P2)

An administrator or developer queries the Supabase database to review historical task submissions, analyze patterns, and verify that logging is working correctly.

**Why this priority**: While not part of the user-facing application, the ability to access logged data is essential for the feature's purpose. This validates that persistence is actually occurring.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting several tasks through the UI, then querying the Supabase table directly (via dashboard or SQL) to confirm all submissions appear with complete and accurate data, delivering value through data verification and analytics enablement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple tasks have been submitted over time, **When** querying the database table, **Then** all submissions appear in chronological order with accurate timestamps
2. **Given** a specific task was submitted, **When** searching for it by task text, **Then** the database record contains the exact original text and AI analysis fields
3. **Given** tasks were submitted by different users or sessions, **When** reviewing the database, **Then** each record can be distinguished and there are no duplicate or missing entries
4. **Given** the database table exists, **When** examining its structure, **Then** all required columns (task text, priority, categories, complexity, suggested order, timestamp) are present with appropriate data types

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the database returns a slow response (5+ seconds) - does it block the UI?
- What happens when the database write succeeds but confirmation never arrives due to network issues?
- How does the system handle database schema mismatches (missing columns, renamed fields)?
- What happens when the user submits extremely long task descriptions that might exceed database field limits?
- How does the system behave when database service quota limits are reached?
- What happens if categories array is extremely large or contains special characters?
- How does the system handle duplicate submissions of identical tasks?
- What happens when timestamp generation fails or produces invalid values?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

  - Original Task Text: The user's input preserved exactly as entered
  - Priority: The HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW value from AI analysis
  - Categories: The array of classification tags from AI analysis
  - Complexity: The HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW complexity assessment from AI analysis
  - Suggested Order: The explanation text from AI analysis
  - Timestamp: The date and time when the submission occurred
- **Database Configuration**: The environment variables VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY that enable connection authentication
- **Logging Warning State**: The UI indicator shown when database persistence fails but analysis succeeds

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users complete the submit-to-analysis workflow in the same time as before database logging was added (no perceivable delay)
- **SC-002**: 100% of successful task analyses result in database write attempts, regardless of write outcome
- **SC-003**: Users can complete task analysis successfully even when the database service is completely unavailable (100% uptime independence)
- **SC-004**: Database failures display a warning message within the results view without breaking the layout or analysis visibility
- **SC-005**: All logged records in the database contain complete data with all six required fields (task text, priority, categories, complexity, suggested order, timestamp)
- **SC-006**: The application never exposes database credentials in browser console logs, network inspector, or client-side code
- **SC-007**: Developers can verify successful logging by querying the database directly and finding all submitted tasks with accurate data

## Assumptions

- The application uses Supabase's JavaScript client library for database interactions
- Database writes are asynchronous and do not block the JavaScript event loop
- The Supabase table schema will be created separately (manual setup or migration script) before logging begins
- The anonymous key (anon key) has sufficient permissions to insert records into the tasks table
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase allow insertions from the frontend
- Database field types are compatible with the data being stored (text for strings, array for categories, timestamp for dates)
- Network timeouts for database operations are handled by the Supabase client library
- The application remains a single-page app with no backend server or API proxy
- Fire-and-forget means the application initiates the write but doesn't wait for success confirmation before proceeding
- Warning messages are displayed in a non-modal format (toast, inline banner, or status indicator)

## Dependencies

- Existing Gemini AI integration (Feature 002) must be functional and returning structured analysis
- Supabase project created with a table schema that matches the required fields
- Supabase JavaScript client library installed as a project dependency
- Valid Supabase project URL and anonymous API key with insert permissions
- Internet connectivity for database access
- Modern browser with fetch API support and JavaScript enabled
- Vite build tool for environment variable injection

## Out of Scope

- User authentication or authorization for database access
- Editing or deleting previously logged tasks through the UI
- Displaying historical task submissions to users in the application
- Advanced analytics or reporting features on logged data
- Database schema creation or migration tools
- Retry logic for failed database writes
- Bulk export or data archiving features
- Real-time synchronization or live updates of logged tasks
- Data validation beyond what Gemini returns
- Duplicate detection or deduplication of similar tasks
