# Specification Quality Checklist: Gemini AI Integration for Task Prioritization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 17, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **Passed** - The specification focuses on WHAT the system should do (call Gemini API, display results, handle errors) without specifying HOW to implement it. While Gemini API is mentioned, it's named as the business requirement, not as an implementation detail.

✅ **Passed** - The specification is written from the user's and business perspective, focusing on benefits like "intelligent, contextual analysis" and "clear, actionable error messages."

✅ **Passed** - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Technical concepts (API keys, environment variables) are explained in terms of their purpose rather than technical mechanics.

✅ **Passed** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with substantial content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **Passed** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. The specification makes reasonable assumptions documented in the Assumptions section.

✅ **Passed** - Each requirement is specific and testable. For example, FR-004 specifies "Priority as one of exactly three values: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW" which can be verified.

✅ **Passed** - All success criteria are measurable (e.g., "within 5 seconds", "100% of successful API responses", "no silent failures").

✅ **Passed** - Success criteria avoid implementation details. For example, SC-001 says "within 5 seconds under normal network conditions" rather than specifying timeout values or HTTP configurations.

✅ **Passed** - Each user story includes detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format covering various conditions.

✅ **Passed** - The Edge Cases section identifies 7 specific scenarios including malformed JSON, unexpected values, timeouts, and language handling.

✅ **Passed** - The Out of Scope section clearly defines what will NOT be included (backend proxy, caching, retry logic, etc.).

✅ **Passed** - Dependencies section lists all prerequisites. Assumptions section documents 10 key assumptions about the technical context.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **Passed** - The 20 functional requirements align with the 5 user stories and are independently verifiable through the acceptance scenarios.

✅ **Passed** - User scenarios cover the complete journey: receiving AI analysis (P1), configuring API access (P1), handling errors (P1), seeing loading feedback (P2), and handling diverse inputs (P2).

✅ **Passed** - The 7 success criteria directly measure the outcomes promised in the user stories (contextual analysis, error clarity, secure key handling, immediate feedback).

✅ **Passed** - The specification maintains separation between requirements (WHAT) and implementation (HOW). For example, it requires "structured prompt" without specifying prompt engineering techniques.

## Overall Status

**✅ READY FOR PLANNING**

This specification successfully:
- Defines clear, measurable outcomes for AI integration
- Provides comprehensive error handling requirements
- Maintains technology-agnostic language while acknowledging the named requirement (Gemini API)
- Documents realistic assumptions for a workshop demo context
- Prioritizes user stories effectively (three P1 core features, two P2 enhancements)
- Includes thorough edge case analysis

No blocking issues identified. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if additional stakeholder input is needed.
