# Feature Specification: Gemini AI Integration for Task Prioritization

**Feature Branch**: `002-gemini-ai-integration`  
**Created**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enhance the Task Prioritizer to use real Gemini AI instead of hardcoded responses. When the user submits a task: - Call the Gemini API with the task text from the frontend - Use a prompt that asks Gemini to analyze the task and return structured data: Priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), Categories (array of relevant work tags like CRITICAL-PATH, USER-FACING, SECURITY, TECH-DEBT, etc.), Estimated Complexity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), and Suggested Order (one sentence explaining why this priority makes sense) - Parse Gemini's response and display it in the existing side-by-side format"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Receive AI-Powered Task Analysis (Priority: P1)

A user submits any task description and receives intelligent, contextual analysis generated by Gemini AI based on the task's actual content, rather than predefined hardcoded responses.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value enhancement that transforms the application from a static demo into a useful productivity tool. Users gain real insights about their unique tasks instead of seeing pattern-matched responses.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a novel task description not in the hardcoded examples (e.g., "Implement OAuth2 authentication for mobile app"), clicking submit, and verifying that the AI analysis is contextually relevant to that specific task, delivering immediate value through intelligent prioritization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user enters a unique task not in hardcoded examples, **When** they click submit, **Then** the AI analysis reflects the specific content and context of that task
2. **Given** the user submits "Refactor database connection pooling for better performance", **When** the analysis appears, **Then** the Priority, Categories, Complexity, and Suggested Order are logically related to database optimization work
3. **Given** the user submits two similar but distinct tasks, **When** they review both analyses, **Then** the AI provides differentiated insights reflecting the nuances between the tasks
4. **Given** the API successfully returns data, **When** results are displayed, **Then** all four required fields (Priority, Categories, Complexity, Suggested Order) are populated with AI-generated content

### User Story 2 - Configure API Access via Environment Variables (Priority: P1)

A developer sets up the application by providing a Gemini API key through environment variables, enabling the app to authenticate with Google's AI services.

**Why this priority**: Without API authentication, the AI integration cannot function. This is a prerequisite for the entire feature and follows security best practices by keeping credentials out of source code.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting the VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable, starting the application, submitting a task, and verifying that the API call succeeds, delivering value by enabling secure credential management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer has set VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY in the environment, **When** the application starts, **Then** the API key is loaded and available for API requests
2. **Given** the API key is not set, **When** the application starts, **Then** the system detects the missing configuration before any API calls are attempted
3. **Given** the application is deployed to different environments, **When** different API keys are used, **Then** each environment uses its own key without code changes

---

### User Story 3 - Understand API Failures Through Clear Error Messages (Priority: P1)

A user encounters an API error (network issue, invalid key, rate limit) and receives a clear, actionable error message explaining what went wrong and how to resolve it.

**Why this priority**: API calls can fail for many reasons, and users need to understand whether the problem is temporary, configuration-related, or requires intervention. Good error handling prevents user frustration and support burden.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating API failures (disconnect network, use invalid key, exhaust rate limits) and verifying that each scenario displays a specific, user-friendly error message rather than technical jargon or silent failure, delivering value through transparency and troubleshooting guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the network connection is unavailable, **When** the user submits a task, **Then** the system displays "Unable to connect to AI service. Please check your internet connection and try again."
2. **Given** the API key is invalid or expired, **When** the user submits a task, **Then** the system displays "API authentication failed. Please check your API key configuration."
3. **Given** the rate limit is exceeded, **When** the user submits a task, **Then** the system displays "AI service rate limit reached. Please wait a moment before trying again."
4. **Given** an unexpected API error occurs, **When** the user submits a task, **Then** the system displays a generic but helpful message like "AI service temporarily unavailable. Please try again shortly."
5. **Given** an error is displayed, **When** the user reviews the message, **Then** technical error codes or stack traces are not visible to the user

---

### User Story 4 - Experience Responsive Feedback During API Calls (Priority: P2)

A user submits a task and receives visual feedback indicating that the AI analysis is in progress, preventing confusion about whether the system is working.

**Why this priority**: API calls take time (typically 1-3 seconds), and users need assurance that their request is being processed. This enhances perceived responsiveness without changing actual performance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a task and observing that a loading indicator appears immediately and remains visible until results are displayed, delivering value through improved user experience and reduced perceived wait time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user clicks submit, **When** the API call is in progress, **Then** a loading indicator appears to show activity
2. **Given** the loading indicator is visible, **When** the API returns results, **Then** the loading indicator disappears and results are displayed
3. **Given** the API call fails, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the loading indicator disappears and the error message is displayed
4. **Given** the loading indicator is active, **When** the user tries to submit again, **Then** the submit button is disabled to prevent duplicate requests

---

### User Story 5 - Maintain Application Usability Across Different Task Inputs (Priority: P2)

A user submits various types of task descriptions (short, long, technical, non-technical, vague, specific) and consistently receives structured analysis regardless of input characteristics.

**Why this priority**: Real-world tasks vary widely in detail and clarity. The AI integration should handle this diversity gracefully, though core functionality is proven with standard inputs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a variety of task formats and lengths, verifying that each produces valid structured output with all required fields, delivering value through robustness and reliability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user enters a very short task like "Fix bug", **When** they submit, **Then** the AI generates a complete analysis with all four fields
2. **Given** the user enters a lengthy task description with multiple sentences, **When** they submit, **Then** the AI analyzes the full context and returns structured results
3. **Given** the user enters a vague task like "Make it better", **When** they submit, **Then** the AI provides analysis that acknowledges the ambiguity in the Suggested Order field
4. **Given** the user enters technical jargon or domain-specific terms, **When** they submit, **Then** the AI demonstrates understanding in its categorization and complexity assessment

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the API returns malformed JSON that doesn't match the expected schema?
- What happens when Gemini returns Priority or Complexity values outside the expected HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW set?
- How does the system handle API responses that omit one or more required fields (e.g., missing Categories array)?
- What happens when the user submits a task in a non-English language?
- How does the system behave when the API call times out after 30+ seconds?
- What happens if the API returns an empty or null response?
- How does the system handle extremely long API response times that might frustrate users?
